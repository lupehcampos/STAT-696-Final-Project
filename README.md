# STAT-696 Final Project: Auto MPG Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for the STAT-696 final project, which focuses on modeling and predicting fuel efficiency (mpg) of automobiles using linear regression and feature selection techniques.

## Project Overview
The project analyzes the Auto MPG dataset to:
- Explore relationships between mpg, horsepower, weight, and model year.
- Fit a linear regression model using a log-transformed response.
- Perform variable selection using $R^2_a$ and PRESS criteria.
- Diagnose model assumptions: linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality.
- Apply Box-Cox transformations and evaluate residuals for outliers and influential points.
